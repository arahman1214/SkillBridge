The primary objective of SkillBridge is to provide a comprehensive platform for job seekers to assess their current skills, identify gaps, and receive tailored recommendations for improvement. This initiative aims to empower individuals to align their skill sets with the demands of their desired job roles, thereby enhancing their employability and career prospects. The scope of the project encompasses the development of a full-stack web application leveraging cloud technologies to ensure scalability, reliability, and seamless user experience. The application targets a wide range of users, from recent graduates to experienced professionals seeking to advance or pivot their careers.

The design phase of SkillBridge was marked by meticulous planning and strategic decision-making to establish a robust foundation for the application. Key outcomes of this phase included the formulation of a detailed cloud architecture blueprint, the creation of a dynamic and user-friendly interface, and the development of a secure and efficient backend. The architecture was designed to be modular and scalable, allowing for easy integration of additional features and services in the future. The data model was carefully crafted to optimise storage and retrieval processes, ensuring swift and accurate responses to user queries.

The database design involved the curation of skills from various resources, including data scraping and designing the database model, which led to understanding the relationships and data flow to visualise our software end-to-end. Brainstorming the user interfaces for each feature by designing UI mockups and React.js pages accordingly resulted in the seamless overall interface of our software. 
Additionally, designing the cloud architecture to cater to the front-end, backend, and data processing services, as well as ensuring security and scalability, further contributed to our project's success.
